# Saturn Blaze

A spaceship shooting game, which is actually a race. sort of like Mario Kart, only with spaceships, lasers, and asteroids. The location is on Saturn's ring. The ring is made of obstacles, which you can evade or tackle or blow up. Yep, you have lasers and rockets. 

Cool physical feature, if you fly low, you better fly faster, because the gravity is stronger, and you'll caught up in Saturn's gravity. And vice versa, if you fly high, you should slow down, otherwise you'll drift away into the space void. 

So, if you tackle an asteroid, and get slowed down, you will immediately start plunging down.

Opponents? yep. They will try to hurt you.

Objective? One ring lap.
